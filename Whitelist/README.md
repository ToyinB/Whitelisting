This is a Clarity smart contract that implements a time-based whitelist system with owner controls. Here's a detailed breakdown of its functionality:

Core Features:
1. Whitelist Management - Maintains a list of whitelisted addresses (principals) with expiration times and active status
2. Owner Controls - Only the contract owner can add, deactivate, or update whitelist entries
3. Time-based Validation - Enforces a minimum expiration period of 1440 blocks

Key Functions:
1. `is-whitelisted`: Checks if an address is actively whitelisted and not expired
2. `add-to-whitelist`: Allows owner to add new addresses with expiration times
3. `deactivate-whitelist-entry`: Enables owner to deactivate whitelist entries
4. `update-expiration`: Permits owner to modify expiration times for existing entries

Safety Features:
- Prevents owner from whitelisting themselves
- Enforces minimum expiration time (1440 blocks)
- Includes validation checks for addresses and expiration times
- Uses error codes for different failure scenarios:
  * u100: Owner-only operation failed
  * u101: Entry not found
  * u102: Invalid expiration time
  * u103: Invalid address

Use Cases:
This contract would be useful for:
- Controlling access to other smart contracts
- Implementing temporary permissions
- Managing time-limited allowlists for token sales or other blockchain-based activities
- Creating membership systems with expiration dates

The contract provides a robust foundation for implementing controlled access mechanisms in a blockchain application while maintaining security through owner-only administrative functions and proper validation checks.
